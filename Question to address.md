Opening the .py file allows you to do the input, just doesn't show you the result if you just do it in python on the desktop. You need an IDE to see the actual output. Need something to pause the exit function until you have a chance. Could be an input option at the end "Are you finished with this program? (y/n)". Workshop that a bit and then go from there.
